# HotelReviews_SentimentAnalysis
Py4DS Final Project, Dec. 2017, using sentiment analysis to analyze 515K European Hotel Reviews

My dataset is the "515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe" dataset on Kaggle (https:// www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe). The dataset is a .csv file of size 48MB, containing most text. The positive and negative reviews are already in columns. The reviews are all in English, collected from Booking.com from 2015 to 2017.
The dataset contains 515738 reviews for 1493 luxury hotels in Europe.

Abstract

Using Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis on a dataset with 515K reviews on luxury European hotels, I have obtained a training accuracy of 93.5 percent, and a testing accuracy of 92.5 percent when predicting positive and negative reviews. The most informative words indicating a review to be positive or negative are also found, and positive reviews reflect more on hotel staff and location, while highly negative reviews tend to focus on facilities.
Scatter plots and bubble plots are used to explore the relationship between reviewer experience (leaving multiple reviews) and ratings, as well as reviewer nationality and ratings. Experienced reviewers tend to leave higher ratings for this dataset, and no clear relationship was found between nationality and ratings.
